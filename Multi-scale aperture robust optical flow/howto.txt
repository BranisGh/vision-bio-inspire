In this file you will find an implementation of the 
multi_scale_aperture_robust_optical_flow in python. 

- demo.py : To run the algorithm, you have to open this file and set the variable 'compute':
                    if True, the program will compute the local flow and the corrected flow and save it in a npy file.
                    if false, the program will visualise the flow as the attached video in this file.

- optical_flow.py: This function is called if 'compute' is set to True and calculates the flow.

- utils.py: This file contains two functions. 
                    - local_planes_fitting: Apply plane fitting to estimate plane parameters.
                                            [a, b, c] in a neighbourhood.
                    - view_flow: Visulise the flow
